This is just a test of a new file.

This is a change to the local but not the master.

These are comments in the master but not my local.

This is another local comment on my machine.

This is a change I made in a branch.

Here the master is now ahead of the my local.

This is the change on my local, after the repo master has already had a change.

Here's another test after making test repo upstream.

Test push and pull request

1) Create, 2)add 3) commit, 4) push

addition to testrepo commit is behind master

edit to master not testrepo

this is a forked addition
